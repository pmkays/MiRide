# Complete Implementation of MiRide ride sharing service

'MiRide' is a Java console application that models a ride sharing booking system. This project enables users to create a car, make a booking, complete a booking, search cars, and display car and booking details. Within this particular implementation of 'MiRide' (assignment 2), additional features have been added such as the ability to create a different type of car (Silver Service), the incorporation of exception handling, the option to write (save) files and read aforementioned saved files when the program starts.

Users will be greeted with a menu where a myriad of options will be displayed. Menu options are selected by typing corresponding two-letter words, where the user will then be prompted to fill in the necessary details. The program will validate all user input through the usage of exception handling and preventative measures are also in place to handle invalid inputs. Various business rules have also been considered and implemented to ensure that that all specifications of the criteria have been met adequately.
